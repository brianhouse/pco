Each _connection_ could in fact have it's own function.


The assumption that oscillators with frequency multiples would still sync on the 1 doesnt really hold. ... actually, it does if the listening is symmetrical. The slow one also has to listen to the fast.

Yeah, actually everything syncs just fine. But then what's the point? Can't bend it this way. Need other functions.
